# Adarsh Mamgain

I am sweet 18 doing B.Tech in Computer Science.

I have been learning to create few dynamic websites.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a Harvard's **free** [CS50 Course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript) on web development using python and javascript.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my dynamic website [adarshmamgain.herokuapp.com](http://adarshmamgain.herokuapp.com)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on dynamic webpages. If you are working on the same or need help, please reach me out below on my socials.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been doing these in my whole quarantine.
